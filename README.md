# Full Stack Developer Challenge
This is my Full Stack Developer Challenge Project, including frontend part and backend part;

## Main feature
### Login Page
You can choose both Admin and Employee as your identity, Admin do not needs password and Employee too.But if you want to login as any employee identity, you need to input the exsiting employee username, which can be created by Admin,so your first step should be login into the Admin page,and created some employees.

### Admin Page
At this page,you can add employee as you want, or delete any employee,can you can view all the review among the employees.You can also assign any employee to finish the review of another (or himself/herself) employee who you selected;

### Employee Page
At this page,you can check your review task list that Admin assigned to you, choose any employee you want to review,and input the content, then confirm submit, and you can update it anytimes as you want.
